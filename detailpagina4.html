  <h3>The Railway Children</h3>
  <p>
    Make tracks to the King's Cross Theatre for some classic family entertainment, as The Railway Children returns to the stage.<br> The charming tale, written by Edith Nesbit in 1906, follows the adventures of Bobby, Peter and Phyllis, whose lives are
    changed when their father is taken away by two mysterious men. The family are forced to move from Central London to the countryside of Yorkshire. Playing around and exploring the local railway, the children find themselves on a journey of exploration
    and adventure as they try to discover the fate of their missing father. They also make some new friends, including the local station master, Mr Perks (played by Jeremy Swift) and the kindly Old Gentleman.<br> This production of the play has found
    the perfect home in the King's Cross Theatre, with the purpose-made venue containing a real railway track and platforms alongside the 1,000 plus seats. Taking centre stage of the show is an incredible 60-tonne steam locomotive, adding a dash of period
    magic to an already enchanting story.<br>
