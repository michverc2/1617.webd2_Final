          <h2>Wet Room</h2>
          <h4>L. 10 x W. 6,5 x H. 3,3m</h4>
          <p>One of the two large rooms, it has the most wood on the walls, a stonewall corner, and a 'heraclite' corner (compressed wood chunks, spray painted white), removable absorbin/reflecting panels on the ceiling, so a variety of accoustics are possible here. With the available rolling panels of 1,25m width and 2m high (4 of them) and 2 other of 2m width and 1,25m high you can make huge changes in the acoustics according to your taste. The centre of the room is a large wood floor, the sides are stone floors, big wool carpets are available to adapt the sound. Window with vieuw on the garden.</p>

          <h2>Dry Room</h2>
          <h4>L. 10 x W. 6,5 x H. 3,3m</h4>
          <p>The same dimentions as the Wet Room, but no wood on the walls here, to be able to create a dry sound, but still have the ability to create 'distance' in your recordings, a dry room signal is an advantage on a variety of input signals, you'll be able to get that killer dry drum sound and hear all the details on the cymbals. Also here you can adapt the acoustics, create a reflecting wall of 5m width with the roling panels. A small section also has a heraclite wall. Also removable absorbing/reflecting panels on the ceiling here. The floor is disconnected from the rest of the building, PA rehearsals at loud volumes are possible here on the PA system, also during late hours... and the floor sounds great for foot stomps. We've done PA rehearsals at 105dB throughout the night. The concrete ceiling of 30-50cm takes care of that.</p>

          <h2>Vocal Booth</h2>
          <h4>L. 2,5 x W. 1,7 x H. 3m</h4>
          <p>A booth with direct vieuw on the Control Room, very handy for vocals, percussion, to put an amp or a cab, or a vocalist with acoustic guitar, voice over, etc... One fourth of the volume of this room (which is in fact 2,35 by 2,20m) is bass trap material, so you can get a very neutral recording, great for bass, guitars, and very handy when you have a band recording: set up an amp here and it will not disturb your drum recordings, even with the door from the Wet Room to the Main Hall opened.</p>

          <h4>L. 3,4 x W. 1,8 x H. 3,3m</h4>
          <p>Another extra dry booth where usually the bass cab or amp gets placed: not too small so it's possible to put different cabs or amps in it, and great to isolate that one guitar or bass amp.</p>
